Description: Replicates plots produced by Lord in his 1953 article,
    "The relation of test score to the trait underlying the test."
    This function takes item response theory parameters (currently 2-
    and 3-parameter logistic) as the primary inputs and uses them to
    create plots relating a theoretical normal distribution (representing
    the latent trait and plotted on the x-axis) to the "true score"
    distribution (representing a large number of possible observed test
    results and plotted on the y-axis).
